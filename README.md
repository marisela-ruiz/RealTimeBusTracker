# Real Time Bus Tracker

Track a CTA bus in real time. 

# What Is It?

This project uses JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to track the 18th Street bus of the Chicago Transit Authority in real time. Load the page to locate and track the 18th Street bus. <br> 
*See screenshot below*


# How to Run

Copy and paste https://marisela-ruiz.github.io/RealTimeBusTracker/ into your browser and begin the fun! Alternatively, you can download all files from this repository. Be sure to store all files in the same directory/folder. Load the index.html file and the bus locations will generate. 

# Future Improvements

At the moment the code is not functioning properly. I plan to update and improve the code to pinpoint exact bus locations and to set map markers to an image of a Chicago Transit Authority bus.
